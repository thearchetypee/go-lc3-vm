# LC3-vm

Little computer 3 is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language. This project is developed to get a hands on experience on Golang. It is based on an [article](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) written by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton. 

## Installation
 ```bash
 go install github.com/thearchetypee/go-lc3-vm
```

## Usage

Run a compiled program:

```bash
go-lc3-vm path/to/program.obj
```

> **Note:** Before running the installation command, make sure that the `GOBIN` environment variable is set and added to your system's `PATH`. If you're not sure how to set `GOBIN` to your path, you can refer to the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html#GOPATH) for instructions.
